Inline tags are a subset of the full set of supported doc:`tags`. In most cases they will have the same behavior as their
normal format. In some cases the interpretation done by phpDocumentor is slightly different. Each page will describe the
way tags should be interpreted by tools and how phpDocumentor will handle this.
