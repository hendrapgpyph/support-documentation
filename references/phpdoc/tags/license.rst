@license
========

The ``@license`` tag is used to indicate which license is applicable for the associated
*Structural Elements*.

Syntax
------

.. code-block::

    @license [<url>] [name]

Description
-----------

The ``@license`` tag provides the user with the name and URL of the license that is
applicable to a *Structural Element* and any of its child elements.

It is RECOMMENDED to apply @license tags ONLY to file-level PHPDocs, to prevent
confusion over which license applies to any particular *Structural Element*.

Whenever multiple licenses apply, there MUST be one ``@license`` tag per applicable
license.

Effects in phpDocumentor
------------------------

*Structural Elements* tagged with the ``@license`` tag will show a link to the
given license in case a URL is provided or the name is one of the following

* GPL, or GNU General Public License, version 3
* LGPL, or GNU (Library|Lesser) General Public License, version 3
