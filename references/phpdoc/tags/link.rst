@link
=====

The ``@link`` tag indicates a custom relation between the associated
*Structural Element* and a website, which is identified by an absolute URI.

Syntax
------

.. code-block::

    @link [URI] [<description>]

or inline

.. code-block::

   {@link [URI] [<description>]}

Description
-----------

The ``@link`` tag can be used to define a relation, or link, between the
*Structural Element*, or part of the long description when used inline,
to a URI.

The URI MUST be complete and well-formed as specified in `RFC 2396`_.

The ``@link`` tag MAY have a description appended to indicate the type of relation
defined by this occurrence.

Effects in phpDocumentor
------------------------

.. important::

   The effects of the inline version of this tag are not yet fully implemented
   in phpDocumentor 3. There's only URI support (i.e. no support for
   *Structural Elements*), and even that is available only in long descriptions.

*Structural Elements*, or inline text in a long description, tagged with
the ``@link`` tag will show a link in their description.

If a description is provided with the tag then this will be used as link text
instead of the URL itself.

Examples
--------

Normal tag:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

    /**
     * @link https://example.com/my/bar Documentation of Foo.
     *
     * @return int Indicates the number of items.
     */
    function count()
    {
        <...>
    }

Inline tag:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

    /**
     * This method counts the occurrences of Foo.
     *
     * When no more Foo ({@link https://example.com/my/bar}) are given,
     * this function will add one as there must always be one Foo.
     *
     * @return int Indicates the number of items.
     */
    function count()
    {
        <...>
    }
