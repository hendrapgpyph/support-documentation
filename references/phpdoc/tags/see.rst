@see
====

The ``@see`` tag indicates a reference from the associated
*Structural Element(s)* to a website or other *Structural Element(s)*.

Syntax
------

.. code-block::

    @see [URI | FQSEN] [<description>]

or inline

.. code-block::

   {@see [URI | FQSEN] [<description>]}

Description
-----------

The ``@see`` tag can be used to define a reference to other *Structural Elements*
or to a URI.

When defining a reference to other *Structural Elements*, you can refer to
a specific element by appending a double colon and providing the name of that
element (also called the "Fully Qualified Structural Element Name" or _FQSEN_).

A URI MUST be complete and well-formed as specified in `RFC 2396`_.

The ``@see`` tag SHOULD have a description to provide additional information
regarding the relationship between the element and its target.

The ``@see`` tag cannot refer to a namespace element.

Effects in phpDocumentor
------------------------

*Structural Elements*, or inline text in a long description, tagged with
the ``@see`` tag will show a link in their description.

If a description is provided with the tag then this will be used as link text
instead of the URL itself.
